This program implements inheritance and polymorpism. Monster is the base class while Goblin, Troll, and Dragon are its children. Dragon has two children: Ice Dragon and Fire Dragon. Each monster has an attack the strength of which is determined at random.

To make this program, I have included a makefile. Simply type "make" to produce an executable and type "make clean" to remove all executables and completely recompile the program. Otherwise, "make" will only recompile the files that were changed 

The three most difficult things about this assignment:

(1) What to do with implementing virtual functions?
(2) Do pure abstract classes require any implementation, even of functions that are not virtual?
(3) How does object destruction work with polymorphism?

The three things I learned in this lab:

(1) The difference between overriding and virtual function.
(2) How to create an abstract class
(3) The usefulness of polymorphism
